    <p>This is a simple "Todo List" application. The purpose is to demonstrate proficiency with Angular. The app retrives a number of "todo" items stored in a JSON file and displays them. The items can be marked complete or deleted. Adding items is simulated for this demo and does not actually add to the JSON.</p>
